A Dockerfile is a set of ordered instructions like FROM, WORKDIR, COPY, RUN, EXPOSE, and CMD used to build a Docker image.
GitLab
    GitLab is a complete DevOps platform.
    It includes repo + CI/CD + security + monitoring in one tool.
    Everything is built-in.
    👉 Example: You can push code → build → test → deploy → monitor all inside GitLab.

GitHub Actions
    GitHub Actions is only a CI/CD automation tool inside GitHub.
    It is mainly used to automate workflows like build, test, deploy.
    👉 Example: When code is pushed → run pipeline → deploy to AWS.

✅ Main Difference (Simple Line)
    👉 GitLab = Full DevOps Platform
    👉 GitHub Actions = CI/CD Automation Tool

CI/CD Working Difference
    🔹 GitLab CI/CD
        Uses file: .gitlab-ci.yml
        Has built-in pipeline stages:
            build → test → deploy
        Runners execute jobs.
    🔹 GitHub Actions
        Uses file: .github/workflows/main.yml
        Works on events like:
            push, pull_request, schedul
GitLab is a complete DevOps lifecycle platform, whereas GitHub Actions is a CI/CD automation service used inside GitHub to build, test, and deploy code.
